//! A clas for a WAM device
/**
   Whole Arm Manipulator (WAM) is a 4-7DOF robot manufactured by Barrett Tech. 
   From a device perspective the WAM can be interfaced from either an ethernet
   device (wired or wireless) or a CAN device. On the WAM, the ethernet device
   is connected to a PC104. Thus, when using ethernet you can communicate with
   the onboard computer through a shell or client/server. The downside of this 
   is that the PC104 does all the (CAN) communication with the motors and 
   much of the computation as well. The PC104 can be bypassed and the motor can 
   be controlled by an external PC (see the documentation on how to configure 
   the switches). For this, the external PC must have a CAN device and the 
   communication with the hardware must be established and maintained. The 
   mtsWAM class implements a WAM that can be controlled from an external PC.
   Thus it manages the CAN bus, the pucks present on the CAN bus and the WAM's
   safety module. Operations are pretty basic: set motors torques, set 
   motor positions and get motor positions.
