# sawForceDimensionSDK
SAW wrapper for Force Dimension haptic devices - this is a proof of concept, use at your own risks.

The Force Dimension SDK can be downloaded from the manufacturer's web site: http://www.forcedimension.com/download/sdk

# Linux permissions

The following instructions allow to avoid using `sudo` to access the USB device.  We use a `udev` rule to set the permission and optionally an owner/group.  The following example simply allows anyone to read/write using the permissions 666.

Using `dmesg`, we can find the vendor Id right afer the device is turned on:
```sh
[478324.211029] usb 2-1.5: Product: omega.x haptic device
[478324.211033] usb 2-1.5: Manufacturer: FD 3.0
[478385.766668] usb 2-1.5: USB disconnect, device number 23
[478392.620604] usb 2-1.5: new high-speed USB device number 24 using ehci-pci
[478393.276357] usb 2-1.5: New USB device found, idVendor=1451, idProduct=0402
[478393.276360] usb 2-1.5: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=0
```

For a Novint Falcon, the vendor Id might be different.  For example:
```sh
[2674365.004455] usb 1-1.4: New USB device found, idVendor=0403, idProduct=cb48
[2674365.004464] usb 1-1.4: Product: FALCON HAPTIC
```

Become superuser
```sh
sudo su -
```
then create rule:
```sh
# go to udev rules directory
cd /etc/udev/rules.d/
# create files with new rules
echo "SUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"1451\", MODE=\"0666\"" > 80-usb-force-dimension.rules
echo "SUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"0403\", MODE=\"0666\"" > 80-usb-novint.rules
# restart udev
udevadm control --reload-rules
```

Once this is done, test the provided examples in the SDK `bin` folder.  You should be able to run them without `sudo`. 

# ROS/Catkin build tools

This is by far the simplest solution to compile and run the examples on Linux.
See how to build cisst with ROS/Catkin tools on the cisst wiki:
https://github.com/jhu-cisst/cisst/wiki/Compiling-cisst-and-SAW-with-CMake

When compiling the SAW Force Dimension code, you will need to specify where to find the Force Dimension SDK.  Do a first `catkin build`, this build will fail because the directory containing the SDK is not defined.   To define it, use `ccmake` or `cmake-gui` on the build directory for the SAW Force Dimension component.  For example:
```sh
adeguet1@lcsr-qla:~/catkin_ws$ cmake-gui build_release/saw_force_dimension_sdk
```
In the command above, the ROS workspace is `~/catkin_ws` and the build tree is `build_release`.  You might have `devel` or `devel_debug` depending on your workspace configuration.

Once in CMake, locate `force_dimension_sdk_DIR` and make it point to the directory containing your SDK.  For example, `~/ForceDimension/sdk-3.6.0`.  Hit configure once and the two variables `force_dimension_sdk_LIBRARY_DHD` and `force_dimension_sdk_LIBRARY_DRD` should have been found automatically.

Don't forget to hit "Generate" before quitting CMake.  You should now be able to build using `catkin build --force-cmake`.   The option `--force-cmake` is required to force CMake to run for all packages that depends on the `sawForceDimensionSDK` package.

Once the packages are all built, you must first refresh your ROS environment using `source ~/catkin_ws/devel_release/setup.bash`.

```sh
sawForceDimensionSDKQtExample
```

If you also want ROS topics corresponding to the tracked tools, try:
```sh
rosrun force_dimension_ros force_dimension
```
